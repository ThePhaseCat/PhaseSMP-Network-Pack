# PhaseSMP Rail Network Resource Pack
This is a resource pack used on the PhaseSMP, mainly on the PhaseSMP Rail Network (PhaseRail) 

- Features arrival music for every station on the network
- Updated Minecart sounds to make them quieter

# How to run/use

- Download the PhaseSMP Rail Network Sound Pack as a .zip or as a folder! (Clone Project)
- Extract the .zip, revealing a new folder. Opening that should reveal another folder that leads into the actual resource pack! (Should be called PhaseSMP-Rail-Network-Pack-VERSION NUMBER HERE)
- Place in your Minecraft Resource Pack Folder
- Load it up and enjoy the custom sounds (must use a command block or commands to do)

# Naming System
The sound names in this pack follow a simple formula that is easy to understand and very modular!

 - Sounds are divided between lines/different kinds of sounds
 - Line sounds are then named based on what station they belong to
 - Railroad sounds are based on sounds to support railroads (Such as Railroad Crossing sounds)
 - Starting Annoucement TTS are seperated by Line, and then towards whatever station they are at
 - Resting music is simply named from 1 to any number, no real pattern here.

For example:
"line1/phasecave" plays the arrival music on Line 1 when reaching Phase-Cave Station!
"railroad/railroadcrossing" plays a (nice) railroad crossing alert/sound
"resting/rest4" plays the 4th resting music
"startingannoucements/line1/towards_slimefarm" plays TTS that plays on Line 1 going towards Slime Farm Station
