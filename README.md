# THIS BRANCH IS IN HEAVY DEV AND TESTING, PLEASE DO NOT USE AS AN ACTUAL RESOURCE PACK
This is a resource pack used on the PhaseSMP, mainly on the PhaseSMP Rail Network (PhaseRail)

- Features arrival music for every station on the network
- Updated Minecart sounds to make them quieter
- And more features coming soon!

# How to run/use

- Download the PhaseSMP Rail Network Sound Pack as a .zip or as a folder! (Clone Project)
- Place in your Minecraft Resource Pack Folder
- Load it up and enjoy the custom sounds (must use a command block or commands to do)

# Naming System
The sound names in this pack follow a simple formula that is easy to understand and very modular!

 - Sounds are divided between lines
 - Station names are then listed!

For example:
"arrival/line1/phasecave" plays the arrival music on Line 1 when reaching PhaseCave Station!

# Boring Stuff

Feel free to provide any suggestions for audio and other cool things in this resource pack!
Feel free to use this pack for whatever you want lol, but please do provide credit if you use this pack on your server, or use audio from this pack (most sounds on here were edited/cropped by me)
