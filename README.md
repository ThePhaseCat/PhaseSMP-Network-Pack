# PhaseSMP Rail Network Resource Pack
This is a resource pack used on the PhaseSMP, mainly on the PhaseSMP Rail Network (PhaseRail)

- Features arrival music for every station on the network
- Updated Minecart sounds to make them quieter

# How to run/use

- Download the PhaseSMP Rail Network Sound Pack as a .zip or as a folder! (Clone Project)
- Place in your Minecraft Resource Pack Folder
- Load it up and enjoy the custom sounds (must use a command block or commands to do)

# Naming System
The sound names in this pack follow a simple formula that is easy to understand and very modular!

 - Sounds are divided between lines
 - Sounds are then named based on what station they belong to

For example:
"line1/phasecave" plays the arrival music on Line 1 when reaching Phase-Cave Station!
