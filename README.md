# PhaseSMP Network Resource Pack
This is a resource pack used on the PhaseSMP, with use mainly on the PhaseSMP's Rail Network (PhaseRail)

- Features arrival music and Starting TTS for every station on the PhaseRail Network!
- New Resting Music for when you need to relax and AFK somewhere!
- New Railroad sounds to enhance immersion, such as Railroad Crossing sounds!
- Quieter Minecarts!
- New music for the Nightclub on the PhaseSMP!

# How to run/use

- Download the PhaseSMP Rail Network Sound Pack as a .zip or as a folder! (Clone Project)
- Extract the .zip, revealing a new folder. Opening that should reveal another folder that leads into the actual resource pack! To check this, make sure that when you open the folder, you see a file called pack.mcmeta (Should be called PhaseSMP-Rail-Network-Pack-VERSION NUMBER HERE)
- Place in your Minecraft Resource Pack Folder.
- Load it up and enjoy the custom sounds (Most sounds require a command block to be heard in-game)

# Sound Naming System
The sounds in this pack all follow a simple formula that is easy to understand and very modular!

 - Sounds are divided between Lines, Railroad sounds, Starting Annoucement TTS, Resting Music, and Other Music
 - Line sounds are then named depending on what station the audio belongs to
 - Railroad sounds are based on sounds to support railroads (Such as Railroad Crossing sounds)
 - Starting Annoucement TTS are seperated by Line, and then towards whatever station they are at
 - Resting music is simply named from 1 to any number. There's not really a pattern present
 - Other Music is split into many different categories. This section was made for audio that doesn't have enough purpose to get a full folder, but not enough to just shove the audio without any folder!

For example:
"line1/phasecave" plays the arrival music on Line 1 when reaching Phase-Cave Station!
"railroad/railroadcrossing" plays a (nice) railroad crossing alert/sound
"resting/rest4" plays the 4th resting music
"startingannoucements/line1/towards_slimefarm" plays TTS that plays on Line 1 going towards Slime Farm Station
