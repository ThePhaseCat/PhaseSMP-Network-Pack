# PhaseSMP-Rail-Network-Pack
A resource pack (currently only sounds) to be used on the PhaseSMP Rail Network

- Features arrival music for every station on the network
- Features TTS for every station on the network
- Updated Minecart sounds to make them quieter
- And more features coming soon!

# How to run/use

- Download the PhaseSMP Rail Network Sound Pack as a .zip or as a folder! (Clone Project)
- Place in your Minecraft Resource Pack Folder
- Load it up and enjoy the custom sounds (must use a command block or commands to do)

# Naming System
The sound names in this pack follow a simple formula that is easy to understand and very modular!

-Sounds are divided at first between "arrival" and "tts" (Arrival standing for arrival music and TTS standing for TTS voices)
-Sounds are then divided between lines
-Station names are then listed!

For example:
"arrival/line1/phasecave" plays the arrival music on Line 1 when reaching PhaseCave Station!
"tts/line1/spawn" plays the TTS voice on Line 1 when reaching Spawn Station
