# PhaseSMP-Rail-Network-Pack
A resource pack (currently only sounds) to be used on the PhaseSMP Rail Network (Currently does not work, will be fixed later when I have time)

- Features arrival music for every station on the network
- Features TTS for every station on the network (TTS is basic right now, will be more advanced later)
- Updated Minecart sounds to make them quieter


Feel free to provide any suggestions for audio!
Feel free to use this pack for whatever you want lol
