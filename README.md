# PhaseSMP Network Pack
This is a resource pack used on the PhaseSMP, with use mainly on PhaseSMP's growing Rail Network (PhaseRail). This resource pack aims to make things more "realistic" and also change some textures to better fit the PhaseSMP.

## The current stable release is v2.2, The current beta release is N/A, The current in-progress version is v2.3

# Some of the features include:
- Arrival music for every station on the PhaseRail Network!
- Starting TTS at the start of every line!
- Transfer TTS at select stations
- Resting Music for when you need to relax and AFK somewhere!
- Railroad sounds to enhance immersion, such as Railroad Crossing and Ticket Scanning sounds!
- Quieter Minecarts with new sounds!
- And much more coming in the future!

# How to run/use
- Download the PhaseSMP Rail Network Pack by going to the latest release and downloading the source!
- Extract, revealing a new folder. (We'll call this the Pack)
- Place the pack in your Minecraft Resource Pack Folder, wherever that is!

# Sound Naming System
The sounds in this pack all follow a simple formula that is simple to understand, and easy to change

 - Sounds are divided between Lines, Railroad sounds, Starting Annoucement TTS, Resting Music, and Other Music
 - Line sounds are then named depending on what station the audio belongs to
 - Railroad sounds are based on sounds to support railroads (Such as Railroad Crossing sounds)
 - Starting Annoucement TTS are seperated by Line, and then towards whatever station they are at
 - Resting music is simply named from 1 to any number. There's not really a pattern present
 - Other Music is split into many different categories. This section was made for audio that doesn't have enough purpose to get a full folder, but not enough to just shove the audio without any folder!

For example:
"line1/phasecave" plays the arrival music on Line 1 when reaching Phase-Cave Station!
"railroad/railroadcrossing" plays a (nice) railroad crossing alert/sound
"resting/rest4" plays the 4th resting music
"startingannoucements/line1/towards_slimefarm" plays TTS that plays on Line 1 going towards Slime Farm Station
