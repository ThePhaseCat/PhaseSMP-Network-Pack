# PhaseSMP-Rail-Network-Pack
A resource pack (currently only sounds) to be used on the PhaseSMP Rail Network (should work)

- Features arrival music for every station on the network
- Features TTS for every station on the network (TTS is basic right now, will be more advanced later)
- Updated Minecart sounds to make them quieter

# How to run/use

- Download the PhaseSMP Rail Network Sound Pack as a .zip or as a folder!
- Place in your Minecraft Resource Pack Folder
- Load it up and enjoy the custom sounds (must use a command block or commands to do)

Feel free to provide any suggestions for audio!
Feel free to use this pack for whatever you want lol
